When people actively talk to strangers (except for the case of a social norm), I realize lots of time they have no interest in building a relationship in advance, but out of curiosity of how other human beings are doing. There are lots of solutions to seek immediate attention, both digital and analog. From a digital perspective, social media play a significant role in satisfying that curiosity. From the many options, I choose to explore the relationship between social behavior and interface."],"storyBoarding":"I used the storyboarding method to brainstorm on possible solutions. I decided to play around with user input and interaction to see how they affect the user\'s emotion.","competitor":" In addition to brainstorm on design elements, like input and interaction, I collected and categorized the products I can find, like podcasts, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, to have a general idea of defining my value proposition. Also, I showed around my sketches to friends and professors to evaluate the feasibility and pick user input or interaction. Below is a comparison of how I define myself among all products that deliver the same value. If you want to know more about how I pick the direction, contact me!","prototype":"Based on the outline of user flow, I used Sketch to make prototypes that contain all the functionalities and content for the first round of usability tests. My core concept was to allow users to express their emotions and have as much response as it can be towards the voice pose. In my design system, I used color to represent the emotion, a low-bar prompt to facilitate more reactions from users, and an optional busy screen to simulate the feeling of being surrounded by humans.","userFlow":"After figuring out the specific plan from sketches, I mapped out a diagram of user flow to develop prototypes.","usability":"There were lots of changes made during the process of block-frame and prototyping. I showed each action to five people and observed their reactions and behaviors. During the test, people are more collaborative than I expected, and they pointed out what they think can be improved or what they wish to add directly. However, taking in every single piece of advice I heard can lead to screen creep. People involved in the test may have a different scope or just reflect what they like in the existing products. I only redesigned the steps that multiple get stuck. For example, I redesigned the scroll up menu on the recording page because only people who use iPhone X are trained to adapt to this particular pattern. Other mobile users had no clue how to deal with it or even realized that it was a menu. Thus, I changed the color and used a verbal indicator to teach my users this new user pattern."},"otherProjects":[{"name":"Smooth Hire","link":"/smoothHire"}]},"campy":{"descrip":"This is a year-long design research project based on the research of current technology\'s implementation and conceptual mechanization.","name":"Thesis \u2013 What will we become, now that life means living with computers?
